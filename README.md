# NeuronLearning
Verbose AI platform ready to hack and try new algorithms.

Main goal: write a tunable network manager where implementation of new algorithms is easy through writing own lambda functions.
Project is writen in C++

Installation:
-- clone the github content to some directory
-- install the datasets; currently three datasets are used in some ways in the programs, mnist, cifar-10 and stl-10. One can download mnist from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, cifar-10-binary from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-binary.tar.gz and stl-10 from http://ai.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/stl10_binary.tar.gz
